# folders-protocol

This repository should be a monorepo style with workspaces for development using yarn pnp (yarn set version stable) - with the workspaces implementing the folders protocol.

Git clone the following repositories, copy their package and sources into respective workspaces in the mono repo to join all of their work into this one monorepo in a clean fashion where each is appropriately separated with its own package.json as they all have upstream dependencies.
